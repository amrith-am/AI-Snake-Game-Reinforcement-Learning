# AI Snake Game | Reinforcement Learning

AI driven snake game using Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning.

The game of Snake actually has a trivial, unbeatable solution. It can be driven by Simple Non-ML Technique by just traversing every block of the board, this gives the unbeateablre solution but it is very time taking and very brute force approach.

But we will be using reinforcement learning techinque.
